# What is the Next.js
Next.js is a popular open-source React framework created by Vercel that enables developers to build fast and scalable web applications with minimal setup. It provides features for both server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), allowing developers to choose the most appropriate rendering method for their application. Here are some key features of Next.js:

Hybrid Static & Server Rendering: Next.js allows you to use both static generation and server-side rendering in the same application, providing flexibility in how content is delivered.

Automatic Static Optimization: Pages that do not require server-side rendering are automatically optimized as static pages, improving performance and reducing server load.

File-System Routing: Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where the file structure in the pages directory maps directly to the application's routes.

API Routes: You can create API endpoints within the same codebase, which makes it easy to build full-stack applications.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR): This feature allows developers to see changes in real-time without needing to refresh the browser, enhancing the development experience.

Built-in CSS and Sass Support: Next.js supports CSS and Sass out of the box, enabling developers to import and use styles directly in their components.

Optimized Performance: Next.js includes performance optimizations such as code splitting and prefetching to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience.

TypeScript Support: Next.js has first-class support for TypeScript, allowing developers to use type checking and other TypeScript features seamlessly.

Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): This feature allows you to update static content after the build without rebuilding the entire site, offering a balance between static generation and dynamic content.

Image Optimization: Next.js includes an image component that automatically optimizes images for different devices and screen sizes, improving loading times.
